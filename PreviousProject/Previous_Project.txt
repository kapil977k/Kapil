Project: JAYANT (DRDO)

This was a tri-service project for the Navy, Army, and Air Force, focused on developing a web-based war game application.
The project involved six different teams, each representing neighboring countries. For each team, we created various tasks 
and scenarios, simulating a combat environment. After the simulated battle, the system would generate outcomes, including 
which team won and the win percentage.

We implemented the project using MVC architecture and developed it with Spring Boot. Multithreading was utilized to run 
all tasks simultaneously. ActiveMQ was used to handle messaging, especially for moving the icons representing aircraft, 
naval ships, and army units by publishing precise coordinates.

Since we were working on-site at a DRDO campus, we had to operate in an offline environment with no internet, mobile phones, 
or electronic devices. We relied on an offline version of GitLab for code sharing and VS Code for code merging.

  
Challenges Faced:

One of the main challenges was adapting to the offline environment, which took about a week. The lack of internet or electronic 
devices made it difficult to reference online resources. To overcome this, we created detailed documentation for key code components 
and referred to these documents when needed.
